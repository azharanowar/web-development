// ES6 Practice and Recap...


// 1. Difference Between var, let and const:

/* console.log(testVar);
var testVar = "Var is a not block scope element, That's mean it has hoisting feature. We will not use var anymore.";
console.log(testVar); */

/* // console.log(testLet); // We can't call let variable before declaration.
let testLet = "Let is a block scope element, That's meant there is no hoisting feature. We can't re-declare let variable but we can re-assign let variable value.";
console.log(testLet);
// let testLet = "Re-declaring let"; // We can't re-declare let but we can re-assign value:
testLet = "Re-assigned let variable value."
console.log(testLet); */

// const testConst = "Const is a block-scope elements, that meant there is no hoisting feature. Const can't be re-decalre or re-assign.";
// console.log(testConst);
